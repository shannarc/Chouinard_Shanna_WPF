//Problem:  Will I ride on the Harley today or will I drive the car? If it is windy or rainy outside, I will drive the car and if it is below 80 degrees, I will drive the car otherwise I will ride on the Harley!

var weather = "windy";  //how is the weather, ie windy, rainy, snowy
var temp = 82;         //what is the temperature using whole numbers

if(weather === "windy" ^ weather === "rainy"){
    //If it is windy or rainy, print out to the console, "I will drive the car today!"
    console.log ("I will drive the car today!");
}
