//Problem:  If I am over the maximum weight, I can not jump from the plane

var weight = 162;   //My actual weight
var maxWeight = 230;  //Maximum aloud weight to jump from plane

    //If my weight is less than the maximum weight aloud to jump off the plane, print out to the console, "I get to JUMP!"
    console.log ("I get to JUMP!");
}
