var minsToFeed =[15, 10, 9, 14, 13]; //Amount of minutes it took to feed 4 dogs.

var totalMins = minsToFeed[0] + minsToFold[1] + minsToFold[2] + minsToFold[3] + minsToFold[4] / 5;   //Calculation of the total minutes it took to feed 4 dogs. Now divide the total by 5 to get the average amount of minutes to feed the dogs.
