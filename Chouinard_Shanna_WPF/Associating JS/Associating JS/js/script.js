// Conditional Logic - With an Expression


var kidHeight = 50;
var minHeight = 48;
var sneakerLift = 2;
//if the child is old enough, print to the console "you can ride"
//if the kid is over 48 inches in height
if(kidHeight + sneakerLift > minHeight){
    //code performed of the condition is true
    console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
}
