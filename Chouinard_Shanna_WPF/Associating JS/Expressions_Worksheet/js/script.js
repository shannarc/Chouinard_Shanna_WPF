//Dog Years
//Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so a dog that is 1 year old in human years is 7 years old in "dog years."
//Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in "dog years" based on his actual age.

var humanAge = 2;   //Sparky's age in human years'
var sparkysAge = 7 * humanAge; //Sparky's age in dog years multiplied by human age

console.log(sparkysAge); //print out Sparky's age in dog years
