//10 weapons are cleaned every hour. Determine how many weapons are cleaned within an 8 hour work day.

var hoursDay = 8; //8 hour work day
var weapCleanPerH = 10; //10 weapons are cleaned every hour

var total = hoursDay * weapCleanPerH; //total number of weapons cleaned within an 8 hour work day is calculated by multiplying the total number of hours worked with the number of weapons cleaned every hour

console.log(total); //Print out the total to the console
